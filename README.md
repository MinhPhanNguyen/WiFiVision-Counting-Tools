# CSI Application - WiFi Channel State Information for People Counting

## Overview & Motivation

This repository presents a comprehensive Channel State Information (CSI) system for WiFi-based people counting using ESP32 devices. The system addresses the growing need for non-intrusive, privacy-preserving indoor occupancy monitoring solutions by leveraging WiFi signals instead of traditional cameras or wearable sensors.

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](images/hardwareArchitect.png)

The system consists of four main components working in concert:

### 1. Hardware Layer
- **ESP32 WiFi CSI Device**: Captures channel state information from WiFi signals
- **IP Webcam Integration**: Android device recording synchronized video frames
- **Network Infrastructure**: WiFi router providing communication backbone

### 2. Backend Processing (Flask API)
- **Data Collection Server**: Receives and processes CSI data from ESP32
- **Real-time Processing**: CSI amplitude/phase extraction and filtering
- **Data Storage**: Structured storage of CSI measurements and metadata
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful services for data access and visualization

### 3. Frontend Application (React Native)
- **Mobile Interface**: Cross-platform data visualization and control
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live CSI signal visualization and analysis
- **Data Management**: File handling, export, and device configuration
- **Network Configuration**: IP and device setup management

### 4. Data Processing Pipeline
- **Signal Processing**: CSI amplitude extraction and noise filtering
- **Feature Engineering**: Statistical and frequency domain features
- **Synchronization**: Timestamp-based alignment of CSI and visual data
- **Analysis Tools**: Visualization and statistical analysis utilities

### Data Collection Protocol

**People Counting Methodology:**
- Manual counting and validation by trained researchers
- Ground truth verification through synchronized video recordings
- Precise people counting with timestamp-based synchronization (<50ms accuracy)
- Cross-validation of occupancy counts by multiple annotators
- Consistent counting protocol across all recording sessions

**Collection Environment:**
- Indoor laboratory setting (5m Ã— 4m room)
- Controlled lighting and environmental conditions
- ESP32 positioned at fixed location (1.5m height) for optimal CSI coverage
- IP Webcam recording at 30 FPS with timestamp logging for ground truth
- Standardized people positioning and movement patterns for each occupancy level

**Ethical Considerations:**
- Data collected with informed consent from all participants
- No personally identifiable information stored
- Privacy-preserving methodology using WiFi signals instead of facial recognition
- Compliance with institutional research ethics guidelines
- Anonymous data sharing for research purposes only

### Complete Setup Instructions

**3. Backend Setup (Flask API):**

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd CSI-Application

# Navigate to API directory
cd api

# Create Python virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Flask server
python route.py
```

```

**5. Mobile App Configuration:**

Create a `.env` file in the `CSIApp/` directory:
```bash
# Navigate to CSIApp directory
cd CSI-Application/CSIApp

# Create environment configuration file
touch .env

# Edit .env file with your network settings
echo "EXPO_PUBLIC_API_HOST=YOUR_COMPUTER_IP" >> .env
echo "EXPO_PUBLIC_API_PORT=5001" >> .env
echo "EXPO_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT=10000" >> .env
```

Find your computer's IP address:
```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1

# On Windows:
ipconfig | findstr "IPv4"

# Example IP: 192.168.1.100
# Update .env file with your actual IP:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_API_HOST=192.168.1.100
```

**6. Start the Mobile Application:**

```bash
# In CSIApp directory, start Expo development server
npm start

# Alternative commands for specific platforms:
npm run android  # For Android device/emulator
npm run ios      # For iOS device/simulator  
npm run web      # For web browser
```

**7. Install Expo Go App (Mobile Device):**

- **Android**: Download "Expo Go" from Google Play Store
- **iOS**: Download "Expo Go" from App Store
- Scan QR code from terminal to run app on your device

### Network Configuration & Testing

**8. Verify Network Connectivity:**

Ensure all devices are on the same WiFi network:

```bash
# Test Flask server is running
curl http://localhost:5001/api/status

# Test from mobile device (replace with your IP)
curl http://192.168.1.100:5001/api/status

# Check if devices can communicate
ping 192.168.1.100  # From mobile device to computer
```

**9. Complete System Test:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Flask backend
cd CSI-Application/api
python route.py

# Terminal 2: Start mobile app (in new terminal)
cd CSI-Application/CSIApp
npm start

# Mobile Device: Open Expo Go app and scan QR code
```

### ESP32 & IP Webcam Setup (Optional)

**10. ESP32 Configuration:**
- Flash ESP32 with CSI firmware (contact for ESP32 code)
- Connect ESP32 to same WiFi network

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Connection Problems:**
```bash
# Check if Flask server is accessible
netstat -an | grep 5001

# Check firewall settings (macOS)
sudo pfctl -d  # Temporarily disable firewall for testing

# Check firewall settings (Windows)
# Windows Security > Firewall > Allow an app through firewall

# Verify network connectivity
ping google.com    # Test internet connection
ping 192.168.1.1   # Test router connection
```

**Mobile App Issues:**
```bash
# Clear Expo cache
expo r -c

# Reset Metro bundler
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Python/Flask Issues:**
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version

# Reinstall requirements
pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :5001  # Check what's using port 5001
```
